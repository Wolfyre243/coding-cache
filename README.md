# Wolfyre's Coding Cache
In short, this is a storage zone for all my notes over the course of my study.
### Origin
I'm currently using a note-taking app known as Obsidian, and they offer a paid feature letting you sync notes across the internet. However, I decided to do it myself instead using Git's local repositories and GitHub, hence this repository was born. The name "cache" is an oxymoron but oh well...
By pushing the changes to github, I can access the files anywhere, be it my laptop or home pc. This is really a simple project that, if you haven't already, should try too. It's basically google drive but cooler.
### Contents
The contents are written in markdown (hence the .md files) and are best read using the Obsidian app which is free. It provides a graphical view of the contents in the folders which is pretty cool

This README will be refurbished soon... maybe...
