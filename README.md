# Wolfyre's Coding Cache
In short, this is a storage zone for all my notes over the course of my study.
### Origin
I'm currently using a note-taking app known as Obsidian, and they offer a paid feature letting you sync notes across the internet. However, I decided to do it myself instead using Git's local repositories and GitHub, hence this repository was born. The name "cache" is an oxymoron but oh well...
By pushing the changes to github, I can access the files anywhere, be it my laptop or home pc. This is really a simple project that, if you haven't already, should try too. It's basically google drive but cooler.
### Contents
As of the current commit, there is only one folder, named "Programming Survival Guide". I plan to add more items here, but this will suffice for now.

This README will be refurbished soon... maybe...
