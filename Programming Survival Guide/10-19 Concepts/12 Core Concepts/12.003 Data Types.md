#Data 
Many data types but some languages dont use them
They have different sizes and are stored in [[21.010 Bits and Bytes|bits]]
# String
A series of characters (`char`)
Operations: Conecatenation (+)

# Integer
Ranges from very big numbers (based on the data size)
Operations: + - * /

In other programming languages, more types of Integers may exist:
- Byte (8-bit)
- short (16-bit)
- int (32-bit)
- long (64-bit)
# Float
Decimal values from +- 1.0 x 10$^3$$^0$$^8$ to +- 1.0 x 10$^3$$^2$$^3$ 
17 digits of precision past the decimal point
Size: 32-bit

### Double
Holds more digits than a float can.
Size: 64-bit

# Boolean
Values of true and false
Operations: and (&&), or (||), not (!)

In some languages, values can be read as [[11.003 Truthy and Falsy|truthy and falsy values]].

# Undefined
Has no value; variable is only declared but not assigned (not initialised)
E.g.
``` js
let variableName; //declaration
variableName = 69; //initialisation
```

# Null
No value; empty value
Assigned to a variable to ensure there is NO data.
```js
let variableName = null
```
# Reference Type
JavaScript supports reference (composite) data types
E.g. Object, Arrays, Function
This data type contains multiple values or complex types of info instead of single values stored in the primitive data types (the others here)
