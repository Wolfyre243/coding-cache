Many data types but some languages dont use them
! TODO ! Add data sizes here

# String
A series of characters (`char`)
Operations: Conecatenation (+)

# Integer
Ranges from very big numbers (based on the data size)
Operations: + - * /

# Float
Decimal values from +- 1.0 x 10$^3$$^0$$^8$ to +- 1.0 x 10$^3$$^2$$^3$ 
17 digits of precision past the decimal point

# Boolean
Values of true and false
Operations: and (&&), or (||), not (!)

# Undefined
Has no value; variable is only declared but not assigned (not initialised)
E.g.
``` js
let variableName; //declaration
variableName = 69; //initialisation
```

# Null
No value; empty value
Assigned to a variable to ensure there is NO data.
```js
let variableName = null
```
# Reference Type
JavaScript supports reference (composite) data types
E.g. Object, Arrays, Function
This data type contains multiple values or complex types of info instead of single values stored in the primitive data types (the others here)
