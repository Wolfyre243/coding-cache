#Math 
# Numeric Operators

### The 4 Horsemen
+, -, /, * You should know these by now
+= and -= will add/subtract the value and return the result back to the variable given

E.g. `x += 10 //if x was initially 5, it would be 15 now.`
### Remainder (Modulus)
Sign: %
Returns the remainder of the division
E.g.
`5 % 2 //returns 1`
Use cases:
- An even number is divisible by 2, hence `x % 2` should return 0.
### Exponentiation
Sign: **
Exponent moment
E.g. x$^6$$^9$
### Increment and Decrement
Sign: ++ or --

Post-Increment/Post-Decrement:
- Returns value -> Increments/Decrements it
Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement:
- Increments/Decrements value -> Returns it

# Comparison Operators
Basic comparison. You should know this by now

Less than <
More than >
Less than or equal to <=
More than or equal to >=
Equal to == (Note that for strings, some languages allow for a different approach to check for equal strings.)
Not equal to !=

# Boolean Operators
Operators for boolean [[12.003 Data Types|data types]]
### not (!)
Usage: `!true = false`

### and (&&)
Will return true ONLY if both values are true
Usage: `true && false = false`, `true && true = true`

### or (||)
Will return true if EITHER of both values are true.
Usage: `true || false = true`, `false || false = false`

# Special Functions
Apart from the normal operations (+ - * /), most languages have other math functions.

### Math.floor(x)
Returns x rounded **down** to its nearest [[12.003 Data Types#Integer|integer]].

### Math.round(x)
Return x rounded to its nearest [[12.003 Data Types#Integer|integer]].

### Math.ceil(x)
Returns x rounded **up** to its nearest [[12.003 Data Types#Integer|integer]].

### Math.trunc(x)
Returns only the integer part of x (E.g. 53.8 returns 53)
This was added in ES6.

# String Concatenation
Uses the + operator.
Usage: `"hello" + "world" = "hello world"`
Works with variables:
`"number: " + numVar = "number: 69"`

# Operator Precedence
In order of precedence from highest to lowest down the list:

- ++x, --x
- ! (not)
- ** (exponentiation)
- \*, /, % (Division, Multiplication and Modulus)
- +, -
- <, <=, >, >=
- \==, !=
- &&
- ||
- =, +=, -=. \*=, /=, %=
-
