#Java
#DataStructure

Given the following code:

```java
class Object {
	int instVar = 5;
	
	public static add(n1, n2) {
		return n1 + n2;
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		int localVar = 0;
		Object obj = new Object();
		int newVar = obj.add(3,4);
	}
}
```

# Local Variables

The local variable `localVar` is created in the [[11.002 Stacks|stack]] of the current method aka `main()` (remember; LIFO: last in first out).

The local variables n1 and n2 are 3 and 4 respectively, assigned as the parameters in add.

# Reference Variables

`obj` is the **reference variable** which stores the memory address (can be retrieved by printing `obj` to console)

The `Object` object is created in the [[11.001 Heaps|heap]] memory, pointed by the reference variable `obj` .

# Instance Variables

In the code above, the instance variable `instVar` is stored in the object, which is stored in the heap; hence we can say that the instance variable is created in the heap.
