#Programming #Error 
# Syntax Error
Detected by the compiler
E.g. spelling errors such as `ConsOle.Log("string")`

# Runtime Errors
Causes the program to abort
E.g.
- TypeError
- RangeError

# Logic Errors
Produces incorrect results
E.g.
```js
// Add num1 to num2  
let num1 = 3,  
let num2 = 2;  
num2 += num1 + num2;  
console.log("Answer" + num2);
```
Here, sum of `num1` and `num2` is added back to `num2`
The code runs, but the output is not what we want.
