JavaScript is an UNTYPED langugage, hence a JS variable can hold a value of any data type.
The type of value can change during a program.
E.g.
```js
let x; // x is undefined here  
x = 9999; // numeric type  
console.log(x); // 9999 is printed  
x = "hello"; // string type  
console.log(x); // hello is printed
```
