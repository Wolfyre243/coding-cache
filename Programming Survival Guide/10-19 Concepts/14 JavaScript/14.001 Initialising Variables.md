#JavaScript #Programming 
JavaScript is an UNTYPED langugage, hence a JS variable can hold a value of any data type.
The type of value can change during a program.
E.g.
```js
let x; // x is undefined here  
x = 9999; // numeric type  
console.log(x); // 9999 is printed  
x = "hello"; // string type  
console.log(x); // hello is printed
```

Variables are initialised with a [[12.003 Data Types|data type]], but in JavaScript, all numbers are one type: a double (64-bit float), since it is a weakly typed language (and also the fact that it lets you swap types halfway).
