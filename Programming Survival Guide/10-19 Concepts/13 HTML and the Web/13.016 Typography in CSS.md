# Choosing a Font
Text characters are based on fonts.
- Fonts define the style and appearance of each character in the alphabet

Structure for defining a font for any page [[13.004 HTML Element Tags|element]]:
```css
div {
	font-family: font1, font2, font3;
}
```
A **font stack** is a comma-separated list of fonts, where font 1 is the best-case scenario and font 2 will be loaded in the case font 1 fails to load. Font 3 acts as a backup for font 2, and so on.

### Specific font 
Identified by name and based on a font definition file stored in user's computer or on the web.
### Generic font
Describes the general appearance of the characters in the text but does not specify any particular font definition file
- Supports the font groups *serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive* and *fantasy*.
