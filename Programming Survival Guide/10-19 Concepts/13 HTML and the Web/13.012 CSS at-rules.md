#CSS #WebDev #Syntax
These are rules that instruct CSS how to behave.

Syntax: `@identifier "rule"` 

There are several regular at-rules, each designated by their identifiers, and each has their own syntax.

# Character Encoding
Use `@charset "encoding";`
`encoding`defines the [[13.005 Character Sets#Character Encoding|character encoding]] used in the file.
E.g. `@charset "utf-8"`

# Importing style sheets
Use `@import url;`
`url` is the URL of an external stylesheet file.
