#CSS #WebDev #Syntax
These are rules that instruct CSS how to behave.

Syntax: `@identifier "rule"` 

There are several regular at-rules, each designated by their identifiers, and each has their own syntax.

# Character Encoding
Use `@charset "encoding";`
`encoding`defines the [[13.005 Character Sets#Character Encoding|character encoding]] used in the file.
E.g. `@charset "utf-8"`

# Importing style sheets
Use `@import url;`
`url` is the URL of an external stylesheet file.

# Loading web fonts
Use `@font-face` to access and load a web font
Once the web font is defined using this rule, it is included in the [[11.008 Font Stack|font stack]].
General syntax to include a font face:
```css
@font-face {  
	font-family: name; /*name of the font*/
	src: url (‘url1’) format (‘text1’), /*url is location of font definition file*/
		 url (‘url2’) format (‘text2’), /*and text is an optional desc of font format*/
		 ...;  
	descriptor1: value1; /*optional style properties of the font*/
	descriptor2: value2;  
	...  
}
```
