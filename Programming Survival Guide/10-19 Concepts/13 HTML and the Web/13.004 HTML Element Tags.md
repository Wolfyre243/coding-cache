HTML provides embedded elements to support content from an external source.

# Link Elements

### Anchor Tag
Hypertext Links are created by using these tags.
`<a href="url-here">content</a>`
A link to a location within the document can be created as follows:
- Add the `id` attribute to the element you want to link to in the same document.
- `url-here` will now be the document's file name, added with a `#` and the `id` added previously:
	- `file#id`
