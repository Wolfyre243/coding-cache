# Important Elements

### Metadata tag
Holds important metadata about the document. It is a self-closing tag.
`<meta attribute="value" />`
A list of metadata [[13.007 HTML Attributes#Metadata Attributes|attributes]].

# Embedded Elements
Also known as **interactive elements** as they allow interaction between the user and the element
HTML provides embedded elements to support content from an external source.
### Image Tag
Self-closing tag, provides content from an external source.
Images marked by this tag are known as inline images, placed inline with other content.
Size can be specified using `width` and `height` [[13.007 HTML Attributes|attributes]].
`<img src="filepath" alt="text"` />

# Link Elements

### Anchor Tag
Hypertext Links are created by using these tags.
`<a href="url-here">content</a>`
A link to a location within the document can be created as follows:
- Add the `id` attribute to the element you want to link to in the same document.
- `url-here` will now be the document's file name, added with a `#` and the `id` added previously:
	- `file#id`

A phone number can be linked by including the `tel:` scheme before the number:
- In the `href` attribute, put the following: `tel: phone`, where `phone` is the phone number.
- E.g. `<a href="tel: 82394812"></a>`
The same can be done for an email address, by using `mailto:`
