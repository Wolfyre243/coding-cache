# Important Elements

### Metadata tag
Holds important metadata about the document. It is a self-closing tag.
`<meta attribute="value" />`
A list of metadata [[13.007 HTML Attributes#Metadata Attributes|attributes]].

# Embedded Elements
Also known as **interactive elements** as they allow interaction between the user and the element
HTML provides embedded elements to support content from an external source.
### Image Tag
Self-closing tag, provides content from an external source.
Images marked by this tag are known as inline images, placed inline with other content.
Size can be specified using `width` and `height` [[13.007 HTML Attributes|attributes]].
`<img src="filepath" alt="text"` />

# Link Elements

### Anchor Tag
Hypertext Links are created by using these tags.
`<a href="url-here">content</a>`
A link to a location within the document can be created as follows:
- Add the `id` [[13.007 HTML Attributes|attribute]] to the element you want to link to in the same document.
- `url-here` will now be the document's file name, added with a `#` and the `id` added previously:
	- `file#id`

A phone number can be linked by including the `tel:` scheme before the number:
- In the `href` attribute, put the following: `tel: phone`, where `phone` is the phone number.
- E.g. `<a href="tel: 82394812"></a>`
The same can be done for an email address, by using `mailto:` 

# List Elements

### Unordered List
Syntax:
```html
<ul>
	<li>List Item 1</li>
	<li>List Item 2</li>
	<li>List Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
This will create an unordered list (bullet points).
The list marker type can be changed using [[13.008 Enter CSS|CSS's]] `list-style-type` [[13.018 CSS Properties|property]].
