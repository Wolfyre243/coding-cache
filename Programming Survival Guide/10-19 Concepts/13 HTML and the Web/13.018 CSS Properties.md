# Font Properties

### Font Size
To set text size, we use the `font-size` property
Syntax:
`font-size: size;`
Where `size` is a CSS unit of length in either [[11.011 Relative Units|relative]] or [[11.010 Absolute Units|absolute]] units.

Text is made scalable with all font sizes expressed relative to default font sizes.

Font sizes are expressed using the following keywords:
- xx-small
- x-small
- small
- medium
- large
- x-large
- xx-large
- larger
- smaller
