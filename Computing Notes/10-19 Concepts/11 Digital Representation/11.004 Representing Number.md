#Computer #Data 
The most common way to represent numbers in a computer system is by a string of [[21.010 Bits and Bytes|bits]] called a binary number

# Converting Binary to Decimal

### Weighted sum method
By adding together ALL [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Decimal|decimal]] number values from right to left at postions with a 1:
E.g. 256 + 64 + 32 + 4 + 1 = 357$_1$$_0$ aka 357 as a decimal number.

| Decimal Digit Value | 256 | 128 | 64  | 32  | 16  | 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Binary Digit Value  | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
Note that 256 is the MSB (most significant bit) in a binary number
# Converting Decimal to Binary
Keep dividing the number by 2, keeping track of the remainder until 0 is the result of the division.

| Division | Quotient | Remainder | Value |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | ----- |
| 19/2     | 9        | 1         | 2$^0$ |
| 9/2      | 4        | 1         | 2$^1$ |
| 4/2      | 2        | 0         | 2$^2$ |
| 2/2      | 1        | 0         | 2$^3$ |
| 1/2      | 0        | 1         | 2$^4$ |
Thus, 19 is 11001 in binary.

# Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal
You may come across long strings of bits such as:
0010101010001101 (16-bit)
10001001011001111010111010101110 (32-bit)

This can be difficult for humans to read and write, hence we use the Octal (base-8) and hexadecimal (base-16) system as a shorthand to represent binary.

Hexadecimal (base-16):
Remember ABCDEF? They're back.

Assume the letter H = A2F7

| 16$^3$ | 16$^2$ | 16$^1$ | 16$^0$ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| A (10) | 2      | F (15) | 7      |
Thus:
10 * 16$^3$ = 40960
2 * 16$^2$ = 512
15 * 16$^1$ = 240
7 * 16$^0$ = 7
Total = 41719

### Denoting Hexadecimal
Ways to denote hexadecimal:
- Place '0x' before the hex numeral e.g. 0x3573
- Append a lowercase letter 'h' after the numeral 3573h
- Use the 16 subscript: 3573$_1$$_6$ 
- Specify base 16: 3573 (base-16)

### Extra notes
- If there are not enough MSB digits, pad with 0s to form a group of 4 binary bits

# Signed Numbers
For signed integers, the leftmost bit is used to indicate the sign:
0 for positive and 1 for negative

Three ways to represent signed integers:
- Sign and magnitude
	- negative values are represented by changing the MSB (firstmost bit)
- 1's complement
	- negative values are obtained by complementing each bit of the corresponding positive number
	- e.g. complement of 0101 -> 1010
- 2's complement
	- obtain by forming bit complement of the number, then add 1.
	- e.g. do 1's complement (1010 from above) then add 1 -> 1011

### 2's Complement System
It is the most efficient way to carry out addition and subtraction operations

1101 (-3) + 1110 (-2) = 1011 (-5)
