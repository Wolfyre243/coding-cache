#Computer #Binary

# Addition
There are four rules that need to be followed when adding [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Binary|binary]] numbers:
- 0 + 0 = 0
- 1 + 0 = 1
- 1 + 1 = 10 (binary for 2)
- 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (binary for 3)
If 2's complement is used in the addition, overflow can be ignored.

example (unsigned):

|     | 0001 |     |     | 1   |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| +   | 0101 |     | +   | 5   |
|     | 0110 |     |     | 6   |
example (signed):

|     | 0100 |                                                                                        |     | +4  |
| --- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --- |
| +   | 1010 | <- this is a 2's complement representation of -6                                       | +   | -6  |
|     | 1110 | -> convert to 1's com then 2's com to get the absolute value, then make it negative -> |     | -2  |

# Subtraction
First form the [[11.004 Representing Number#2's Complement System|2's complement]] of the subtrahend (bottom value) then perform normal addition
Done in the same manner for both positive and negative numbers

example:

|     | 1110 | -2  |                        |     | 1110 |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---------------------- | --- | ---- |
| -   | 1011 | -5  | -- form complements >> | +   | 0101 |
|     |      |     |                        |     | 0011 |
# Overflow
Overflow occurs when the answer does not fit in the number range.

### Overflow in Addition
If 2 of 2's complement numbers are ==added==, and provided they **both have the same sign**, then overflow occurs **if and only if** the result has the *opposite sign*
Overflow **never** occurs when adding operands with opposite signs.

Adding 2 +ve numbers MUST give a positive result 
Adding 2 -ve numbers MUST give a negative result

Overflow occurs if:
- (+A) + (+B) = - C
- (-A) + (-B) = +C
E.g.

|     | 1001 (-7)        |     |     | -7  |
| --- | ---------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| +   | 1010 (-6)        |     | +   | -6  |
|     | ==1==   0011 = 3 |     |     | -13 |
Overflow occurs as the largest -ve number is -8

### Overflow in Subtraction
If 2 of 2's complement numbers are subtracted, and their sign are different, then overflow occurs **if and only if** the result has the same sign as the subtrahend (the number being subracted)

Overflow occurs if:
-  (+A) - (-B) = - C
-  (-A) - (+B) = + C

E.g.

|     | 0111 (+7) |     |     | 0111      |
| --- | --------- | --- | --- | --------- |
| -   | 1010 (-6) | ->  | +   | 0110      |
|     |           |     |     | 1101 = -3 |

### Handling Overflow
When adding two signed integers of the same sign, overflow may occur.
Take for example (-7) + (-6) = -13. As seen from above examples, this will result in overflow.
To fix this, we can simply add a 1 in front of the 4-bit integer to make it the leftmost bit, which determines the sign of the integer.
Fun fact: adding this 1 does nothing (i think) as flipping every binary digit in 1's complement will turn this 1 into 0 anyway.

|     | 1 1001 (-7)    |     |     |     |
| --- | -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| +   | 1 1010 (-6)    |     | +   |     |
|     | 1 1 0011 (-13) |     |     |     |
From here, we can see that there is still an extra 1, but the good news is that 11001 (-7) is a 5-bit integer, which increases the range.
Because of this, overflow can now be ignored, and 10011 can be used to find the value of 1 10011.
10011 --1's comp-> 01100 --2's comp--> 01101 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13
thus, 110011 is -13.
