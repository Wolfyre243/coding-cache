An instruction specifices an operation, as well as the locations of its data operands
- Load (Operation) | R1, A (Operands)

A 32-bit [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|word]] usually holds 1 encoded instruction.
A program constitutes of a sequence of instructions which are executed one after the other.
Both the program and its data are stored in the [[10.009 Functional Units#Primary Memory|main memory]].

# Instruction Cycle
Is able to repeat basic operations billions of times per second.

Known as the single cycle of operation.
Consists of 5 phases:
- Fetch ^a50288
- Decode
- Execute
- Memory Access
- Write Back

# Instruction Types

### Load
Reads a data operand from [[10.009 Functional Units#Primary Memory|memory]] or an [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Input Components|input device]] into the [[10.009 Functional Units#Processor|processor]]

### Store
Writes a data operand from a [[10.009 Functional Units#Processor#Registers|processor register]] to [[10.009 Functional Units#Primary Memory|memory]] or an [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Output Components|output device]].

### Operate
Performs an arithmetic or logic operation on data operands in the processor registers.

# Programs

An example program:
A, B, and C are labels for memory word addresses, where Ri represents [[10.009 Functional Units#Processor#Registers|processor registers]].

C = A + B can be represented as:

| Instruction | Operands   | Explanation                                             |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Load        | R2, A      | R2 <- A                                                 |
| Load        | R3, B      | R3 <- B                                                 |
| Add         | R4, R2, R3 | Adds values from R2 and R3 which were previously loaded |
| Store       | R4, C      | R4 -> C                                                 |

# Fetching and Executing Instructions
E.g. Load R2, LOC (line of code)
The control circuits will do the following:
- Sends address in [[10.009 Functional Units#Processor#Program Counter (PC) Register|program counter (PC) register]] to [[10.009 Functional Units#Primary Memory|memory]], issue Read phase
- Load instruction from memory into [[10.009 Functional Units#Instruction Register (IR)|instruction register (IR)]] 
- Increment program counter count to point to next instruction
- Send the address of LOC to memory; issue Read phase
- Load [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|word]] from memory into register R2.
