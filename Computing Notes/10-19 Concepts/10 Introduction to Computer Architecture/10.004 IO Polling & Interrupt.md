#CPU #Computer 
Interrupt and polling are two ways to handle events generated by I/O devices
- These events can happen **at any moment** while the CPU is busy in executing another process
- Interrupt and Polling let the CPU stop its current task and respond to another more important task.

### Polling
In polling, CPU keeps on checking I/O devices at regular intervals, whether or not it needs CPU services

### Interrupt
In interrupt, the I/O devices interrupts the CPU and tells the CPU it needs the CPU's service
