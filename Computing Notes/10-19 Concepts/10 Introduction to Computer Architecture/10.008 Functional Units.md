#Computer 

# Primary Memory
aka Main Memory

Organised into [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|words]] of typically 32 [[21.010 Bits and Bytes|bits]], which contains 4 8-bit [[21.010 Bits and Bytes|bytes]] (4 * 8)
(remember: a byte is made up of 8 bits)
A PC's memory may have 4 gigabytes (GB) or more.
Programs and their data must first be loaded into this memory before being executed by the CPU (sound familiar? see: [[10.002 Components of a Computer#RAM|RAM]])

# Cache Memory
Adjunct to the main memory; fabricated on the processor chip itself.
Smaller but faster than main memory (recall: it uses [[10.002 Components of a Computer#^c0dd9a|SRAM]] and not [[10.002 Components of a Computer#^998650|DRAM]])
Holds sections of the program and data frequently being executed

# Processor
Note: the CPU may not be the only processor in a computer, but these 2 terms are used interchangeably.

A processor contains:
- ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) is where most computer operations are executed.
	- Logical circuits for performing arithmetic and logical operations on [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|word-sized]] data operands.
- Timing and control circuits for fetching program instructions/data from the [[21.007 Cache Memory|memory]], one after another (you'll see why later).
- Registers (usually 16 or 32 of them), each of which hold one [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|word]] of operand data.

The memory, ALU and I/O units store and process information, performing I/O operations.
The **control units** coordinate these operations such that they run one after another.
