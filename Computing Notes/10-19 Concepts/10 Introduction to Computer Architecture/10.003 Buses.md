#Data 
A bus is a collection of wires that carry signals from one place to another on the computer

### Data Bus
Carries **data** signals from main memory (RAM) to CPU and back from I/O devices and vice verse

### Address Bus
Used to carry signals such as a **memory location** or port/interface with an I/O device attached.

### Control Bus
Carries control signals such as reading and writing from CPU to memory/port/interface (I/O)

Analogy: Baking a cake
Address bus gives signals on where to get ingredients from in the supermarket, where the ingredients are data and the supermarket is the main memory.
- The signals of memory addresses given are like places/sections in the supermarket (eggs from dairy, flour from confectionery)
Data bus carries these ingredients from the supermarket (main memory) to the baker (CPU) 
- This can be vice versa i.e. from CPU to m

Summary: A bus usually interacts mainly with CPU for the transfer of data and code
