A bus is a collection of wires that carry signals from one place to another on the computer

### Data Bus
Carries **data** signals from main memory (RAM) to CPU and back from I/O devices and vice verse

### Address Bus
Used to carry signals such as a **memory location** or port/interface with an I/O device attached.

### Control Bus
Carries control signals such as reading and writing from CPU to memory/port/interface (I/O)

Summary: A bus usually interacts mainly with CPU for the transfer of data and code
