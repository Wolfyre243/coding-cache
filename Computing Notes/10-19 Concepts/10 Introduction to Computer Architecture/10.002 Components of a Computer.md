#Computer
## Input Components
These components are used to get [[10.001 Basic Function of Computers#Input|input]] from external devices
Examples include:
- Keyboards, microphones, webcams
- Storage devices: hard disks and CDs/DVDs
---
## Processing Components
The #CPU is a computer's main [[10.001 Basic Function of Computers#Processing|processing]] component. which executes instructions from computer programs (word processors, [[Operating Systems|operating systems]])
It is comprised of 2 or more processors called **cores**.
- Multicore CPUs can carry out multiple tasks simultaneously, increasing overall performance.
---
## Output Components
Examples:
- Monitors, printers

## Storage Components
### Ram
Stands for Random-Access Memory
Contains DIMMs with 160-280 pins, with a 64-bit [[21.004 Data Paths|data path]]
[[21.003 Volatility]] (short-term) storage for temporary files.

How RAM works:
- Data is first stored in hard drive
- Data is then loaded into the RAM on the computer when the CPU requires it.
- If there is insufficient RAM, the computer will make use of the [[21.001 Virtual Memory|virtual memory]] in the disk space
- When PC is shut off, all of the RAM's files are gone

Types of RAM:
- DRAM (Dynamic RAM) -> contains capacitors that need to be refreshed constantly (power intensive)
	- Runs Async with system clock
- SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic RAM)
	- Runs synchronously with system clock

PC-100 RAM refers to the speed in MHz in which the RAM operates (100 MHz)
RAM is linked to the CPU via [[21.002 Bus|buses]]
### Hard Drives
Non-volatile (long-term) disks for permanent storage
Maintains its data even when there's no power
Examples:
- CDs, DVDs
