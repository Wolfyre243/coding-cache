#Computer 
# BIOS
Stands for basic input/output system 
It is a set of instructions located in a [[21.008 ROM|ROM]] chip on the computer's [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Motherboard|motherboard]]
- This tells the [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Processing Components|CPU]] to perform certain tasks when power if first applied to the computer.
	- E.g. POST (Power On Self Test)
- After doing a POST, the BIOS will look for the system's [[21.005 Operating Systems|OS]] stored in a [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Hard Drives|HDD]].
- It then loads the OS into your system's [[10.002 Components of a Computer#RAM|RAM]], which then takes control of the system's CPU.

Newer motherboards use a UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface), which is more user friendly as it uses a graphical interface.

# CMOS
Stands for Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
BIOS settings are retained in the CMOS chip.

# Booting
When a computer boots, the BIOS offers a chance to run the setup utility
- This lets users configure hardware components
