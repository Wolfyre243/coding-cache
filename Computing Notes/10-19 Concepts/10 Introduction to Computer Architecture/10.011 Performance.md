Factors affecting performance:
- Speed of electronic circuits in the processor
- Time taken to access [[21.007 Cache Memory|cache]] and [[10.009 Functional Units#Primary Memory|main memory]] 
- Design of instruction set
- Number of operations that can be done at the same time (parallelism)

# Technology
Improvements in the materials used to make transistors means [[10.010 Instructions and Programs#Instruction Cycle|instructions]] can be executed faster

Improvements in process technology means more transistors can be placed on a chip
This leads to:
- more logic functionality
- more memory storage capacity

# Parallelism
The use of multicore processors than have multiple processing units fabricated on a single chip
