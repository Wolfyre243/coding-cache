An [[10.010 Instruction Cycle|instruction]] specifices an operation, as well as the locations of its data operands
- Load (Operation) | R1, A (Operands)

A 32-bit [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Word|word]] usually holds 1 encoded instruction.
A program constitutes of a sequence of instructions which are executed one after the other.
Both the program and its data are stored in the [[10.008 Functional Units#Primary Memory|main memory]].

# Instructions

### Load
Reads a data operand from [[10.008 Functional Units#Primary Memory|memory]] or an [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Input Components|input device]] into the [[10.008 Functional Units#Processor|processor]]

### Store
Writes a data operand from a [[10.008 Functional Units#Processor#Registers|processor register]] to [[10.008 Functional Units#Primary Memory|memory]] or an [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Output Components|output device]].

### Operate
Performs an arithmetic or logic operations
