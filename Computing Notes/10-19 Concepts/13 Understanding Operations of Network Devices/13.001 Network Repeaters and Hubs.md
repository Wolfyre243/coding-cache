#Computer #Networks 
Early networking devices do not use interconnecting devices and the cable length is severely limited due to [[21.024 Signal Attenuation |signal attenuation]]. 
Such problems can be resolved using devices like repeaters.
# Repeater
A repeater receives signals in bits ([[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Binary|binary]]) generated by [[10.006 Fundamentals of Network Communication#NIC Basics|NICs]] and other networking devices
It **strengthens** them and then "repeats" them to other parts of the network.
- This allows the repeater to connect computers whose distance from one another is very far.
### Ports
Traditional repeaters have two ports or connections that can be used to extend your network.

Multiport Repeaters aka Hubs are repeaters that contain several ports to which cables can be connected.
- Receives bit signals generated from a connected computer's NIC on one of its ports.
- Cleans the signal, regenerating it back to full strength, and transmits this signal to all other ports where a computer is connected to.

In a Hub, a [[21.025 Frames and Packets|frame]] is passed along or "broadcasted" to every one of its ports.
The hub sends it to every port connected to a computer, which ensures that the frame reaches its destination.
However, this can lead to a lot of traffic on the network and thus lead to poor speeds.
Thus, hubs are not intelligent and are rather slow, not to mention bad for security.
