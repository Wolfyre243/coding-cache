A NIC provides the physical connection from the computer to the [[12.001 Network Components#Hardware Components|network medium]].
The NIC can be built into the computer's motherboard or added as a seperate card.

# Operation of the NIC
The NIC handles incoming/outgoing [[21.025 Frames and Packets|frames]] into/out of a computer.

Incoming data (frames):
- Receives bit signals (from a [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs|hub]]?) and assembles them into [[21.025 Frames and Packets|frames]] 
- Verifies the destination MAC address (part of framing)
- Verfies the CRC
- Removes the frame header and trailer and sends the resulting packet to the network protocol layer.

Outgoing data (frame):
- Receives the packet from the network protocol layer
- Adds the frame header and trailer to form the frame
- Convert the frame into bits for transmission on the network layer.

Each NIC also has a unique [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC address]] assigned to it.
