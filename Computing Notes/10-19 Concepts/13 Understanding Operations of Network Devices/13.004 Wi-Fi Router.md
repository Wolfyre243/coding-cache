# Wifi Bands
Routers can have different [[21.019 LAN#Wireless LAN Standards|bands]], or dual bands, known as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

### 2.4 GHz
The most common band, it is also used by other devices such as microwaves, and telephones, which makes the wifi vulnerable to interference from these devices.

This band has a slower speed but longer range.
Can penetrate solid objects better as it is low frequency.

### 5 GHz
This band is less common, and thus has lesser interference.

This band has faster speed, but a smaller range.
High frequencies as such have a hard time penetrating walls, which is a weakness on its end.
