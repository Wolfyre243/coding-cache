A Wifi-Router creates an [[21.020 Internetworks|internetwork]], connecting multiple [[21.019 LAN|LANs]] together by forwarding packets from one LAN to another.
It sends and receives [[21.025 Frames and Packets|packets]] across the [[12.004 Internet, Intranet, Extranet|internet]].

A Wifi-Router is assigned an [[21.023 IP Addresses#Router / Gateway IP Address|IP address]] that is need to connect to the internet. This is known as the gateway/router IP address.

A router creates multiple broadcast domains. (hence it doesnt forward broadcasts)
- A router breaks collision AND broadcast domains, making it both a collision and broadcast domain seperator.
- A broadcast message from one network will never reach the other one because the router will never let it pass.

Routers work with [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP Addresses]] (unlike [[13.002 Network Switches|switches]] which work with [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC addresses]])
Routers work with [[21.025 Frames and Packets#Packets|packets]] while switches work with [[21.025 Frames and Packets#Frame|frames]] 

Routers work with routing tables.

# Connecting LANs
When computers are added to LANs, the effective communication can suffer.
- Broadcast traffic is forwarded to all members of a LAN, causing the network to be congested.
- Computers are connected to one LAN through the use of switches, and as a result all broadcast traffic can be heard by all devices.

A better solution to this, would be to use a router instead to link multiple LANs together.
- This can facilitate more effective communication within LANs and between LANs

# Routing Tables
If the network can't be found and there is no default route, the message "Network Unreachable" is sent.
### Default Route
Where to send a packet when the router has 0 entries in its routing table.

### Default Gateway
An IP address in the computer's IP address configuration, which is the IP address of the router by default.

# Firewalls
An external firewall protects the web server itself from attacks, while an internal firewall protects internal corporate systems in case the first one fails to protect.

Routers have built-in firewalls.
There are two types of firewalls:
### Network-based Firewalls
Usually found in routers; can be bought as a seperate product too.
Protects the entire network.
### Host-based Firewalls
Comes with the computer itself, provides extra protection in the event the network-based on fails.

### DMZs (Demilitarised Zones)
Used to improve the security of an organisation's network.

When companies let in people from an untrusted network such as the Internet, their servers' security is compromised as the firewall lets them through, making them vulnerable

A DMZ divides a network into 2 parts, ensuring that only legitimate traffic is allowed to pass.

The DMZ ensures that any malicious traffic cannot pass into the internal network by sandwiching itself between two firewalls, making it more difficult for hackers to breach the firewall.

# Wifi Bands
Routers can have different [[21.019 LAN#Wireless LAN Standards|bands]], or dual bands, known as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

### 2.4 GHz
The most common band, it is also used by other devices such as microwaves, and telephones, which makes the wifi vulnerable to interference from these devices.

This band has a slower speed but longer range.
Can penetrate solid objects better as it is low frequency.

### 5 GHz
This band is less common, and thus has lesser interference.

This band has faster speed, but a smaller range.
High frequencies as such have a hard time penetrating walls, which is a weakness on its end.
