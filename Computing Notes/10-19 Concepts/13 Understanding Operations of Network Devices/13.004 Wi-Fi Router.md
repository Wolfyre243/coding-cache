A Wifi-Router creates an [[21.020 Internetworks|internetwork]], connecting multiple LANs together.
It sends and receives [[21.025 Frames and Packets|packets]] across the [[12.004 Internet, Intranet, Extranet|internet]] 
A Wifi-Router is assigned an [[21.023 IP Addresses#Router / Gateway IP Address|IP address]] that is need to connect to the internet. This is known as the gateway/router IP address.

A router creates multiple broadcast domains.
- A router breaks collision AND broadcast domains, making it both a collision and broadcast domain seperator.
- A broadcast message from one network will never reach the other one because the router will never let it pass.
# Wifi Bands
Routers can have different [[21.019 LAN#Wireless LAN Standards|bands]], or dual bands, known as 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.

### 2.4 GHz
The most common band, it is also used by other devices such as microwaves, and telephones, which makes the wifi vulnerable to interference from these devices.

This band has a slower speed but longer range.
Can penetrate solid objects better as it is low frequency.

### 5 GHz
This band is less common, and thus has lesser interference.

This band has faster speed, but a smaller range.
High frequencies as such have a hard time penetrating walls, which is a weakness on its end.
