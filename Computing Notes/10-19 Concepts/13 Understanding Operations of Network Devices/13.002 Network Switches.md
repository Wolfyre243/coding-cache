#Computer #Networks 
Looks similar to a [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs|hub]], but actually reads the data in the message and determines which port the destination device is connected to and forwards the message to only that port.

# Basic Switch Operation
Below is how a switch works:
- Data is sent onto the medium one frame at a time
- Each frame has the destination and source [[10.006 Fundamentals of Network Communication#MAC Address|MAC Address]].
- The switch reads the addresses, using the source MAC address of the frame to keep a record of which computer is on which port (stored in a switching table)
- The switch then forwards the frame to the port where the destination MAC is found.
