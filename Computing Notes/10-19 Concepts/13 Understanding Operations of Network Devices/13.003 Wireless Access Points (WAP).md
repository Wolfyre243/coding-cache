Used mostly in medium to large sized organisations
WAPs are connected to routers using ethernet cables which transmit data.
This data is then transmitted wirelessly to devices connected wirelessly to the WAP.
The network is still managed by a single router; the access points just allow for better connection to the wifi router.

A WAP is basically similar to a [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs|hub]] without wires.
All communication processes will go through

# Bandwidth
Bandwidth of a wireless AP is shared by all wireless client devices, similar to a hub.
With more wireless devices connected to the [[21.019 LAN|wireless LAN]], the lesser bandwidth for each wireless client devices. 

### Half-Duplex
Wireless APs only operate in half-duplex, meaning:
- Only one wireless client device can transmit data at a time.
- They may send OR receive data, but never at the same time.
