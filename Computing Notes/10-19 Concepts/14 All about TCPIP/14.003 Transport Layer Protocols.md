Transport Layer protocols are usually used with most Appliction-layer protocols because they:
- Supply a header field to identify application layer
- Provide reliability and flow control for apps that typically transfer a large amount of data

The transport layer has 2 protocols:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

# Similarities
- Both TCP and UDP add headers to the data.
- Both provide a means to identify the source and destination applications involved in a communication
- Both protect data with checksums

# Differences
- TCP works with segments
- UDP works with datagrams

# Adding Headers
