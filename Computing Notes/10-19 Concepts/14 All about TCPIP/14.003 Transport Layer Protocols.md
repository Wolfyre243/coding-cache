Transport Layer protocols are usually used with most Appliction-layer protocols because they:
- Supply a header field
- Provide reliability and flow control for apps that typically transfer a large amount of data

The transport layer has 2 protocols:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (USer Datagram Protocol)

These 2 protocols work with segments (TCP) and datagrams (UDP)
