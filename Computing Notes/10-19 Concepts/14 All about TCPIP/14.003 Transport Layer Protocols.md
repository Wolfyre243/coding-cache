Transport Layer protocols are usually used with most Appliction-layer protocols because they:
- Supply a header field to identify application layer
- Provide reliability and flow control for apps that typically transfer a large amount of data

The transport layer has 2 protocols:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

# Similarities
- Both TCP and UDP add headers to the data.
- Both provide a means to identify the source and destination applications involved in a communication
- Both protect data with checksums

# Differences
- TCP works with segments
- UDP works with datagrams

# Adding Headers

# Port Numbers
TCP and UDP use port numbers to specify the source and destination application-layer protocols.
- These port numbers are 16-bit values assigned to specific applications running on a computer or network device.
- E.g. Port 80$_1$$_0$ is 0000 0000 0101 0000$_2$ (binary) and 50$_1$$_6$ (hex)

Port numbers are divided into three ranges: well-known, registered and dynamic/private.
### Well-Known Port Numbers
These range from 0 through 1023.
