# Layered Architecture

Protocols are rules and procedures for communication and behaviour between computers
- Computers communicating should speak the same language

A cooperative suite of protocols is known as a protocol stack, one most commonly used stack is the [[12.005 TCPIP Stack|TCP/IP Stack]].
A protocol stack is composed of more than a dozen protocols that operae at various different levels of the communication process.

The new updated layers:
1. Application -> SMTP, FTP, [[21.034 Telnet|Telnet]], [[20.002 HTTP|HTTP]]
2. Transport -> [[20.008 TCP|TCP]], [[20.009 UDP|UDP]], Port Numbers
3. Network -> [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP Addresses]], [[13.004 Wi-Fi Router|Routers]] 
5. Data Link -> [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC Addresses]], [[13.002 Network Switches|Switches]], Ethernet
6. Physical -> Cable, [[13.005 Network Interface Cards (NICs)|NICs]], [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs|Hubs]]

### Example of layers working together
- Open up web browser
- Web browser formats a request for the home page <- Application Layer protocol, HTTP
- The unit of information is known simply as "data".
- The HTTP passes down the request down to the Transport Layer Protocol
	- This is known as [[20.008 TCP|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]] or [[20.009 UDP|User Datagram Protocol (UDP)]] (theres a difference!)
- TCP adds a header to the request
- On the Transport layer, the unit of information is known as a "segment"
- TCP then passes the segment to the Internetwork Layer protocol
	- This is known as Internet Protocol (IP)
- IP places its header on the segment. The unit of information is known as a "[[21.025 Frames and Packets#Packets|packet]]".
- This packet is then passed down to the Network Access layer. This is the layer where the NIC operates.
- A frame header and trailer is added by the NIC driver. 
- The frame is then delivered to the network medium as bits
- Frame makes its way to the www.cengage.com DNS server
- Web server processes it and returns a Web page.

# Info being transferred at various layers

1. Application:
	- Data 
2. Transport:
	- TCP Data (segment)
3. Network / Internetwork:
	- IP | TCP | Data (packet)
4. Data Link / Network Access:
	- Ethernet | IP | TCP | Data (frame)
5. Physical:
	- Bits?? (I assume)

# Encapsulation Process

##### Application Layer
1. Start with app data in the Application Layer (Layer 5)
2. This data is passed down to the next layer, the Transport Layer (Layer 4)

##### Transport Layer
1. At this layer, the transport information is added, which is the [[20.008 TCP|TCP]] header.
2. This header contains specific information such as source & destination port numbers, sequence numbers, etc. (for TCP)
3. This entire collection of information is known as a segment.

##### Network Layer
1. At the Network Layer (Layer 3), we add the [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP]] header.
2. This header contains source & destination [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP addresses]], as well as other information
3. This entire collection of info is known as a packet.

##### Data Link Layer
1. At the Data Link Layer (Layer 2), we add both a header and a trailer.
