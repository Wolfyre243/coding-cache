# Layered Architecture

Protocols are rules and procedures for communication and behaviour between computers
- Computers communicating should speak the same language

A cooperative suite of protocols is known as a protocol stack, one most commonly used stack is the [[12.005 TCPIP Stack|TCP/IP Stack]].
A protocol stack is composed of more than a dozen protocols that operae at various different levels of the communication process.

The new updated layers:
1. Application
2. Transport
3. Network
4. Data Link
5. Physical

### Example of layers working together
- Open up web browser
- Web browser formats a request for the home page <- Application Layer protocol, HTTP
- The unit of information is known simply as "data".
- The HTTP passes down the request down to the Transport Layer Protocol
	- This is known as [[20.008 TCP|Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]] or [[20.009 UDP|User Datagram Protocol (UDP)]] (theres a difference!)
- TCP adds a header to the request
- On the Transport layer, the unit of information is known as a "segment"
- TCP then passes the segment to the Internetwork Layer protocol
	- This is known as Internet Protocol (IP)
- IP places its header on the segment. The unit of information is known as a "[[21.025 Frames and Packets#Packets|packet]]".
- This packet is then passed down to the Network Access layer. This is the layer where the NIC operates.
- A frame header and trailer is added by the NIC driver. 
- The frame is then delivered to the network medium as bits 

# Items being transferred at various layers

1. Application:
	- Data 
1. Transport:
	- TCP Data (segment)
2. Network:
	- IP | TCP | Data (packet)
3. Data Link:
	- Ethernet | IP | TCP | Data (frame)
