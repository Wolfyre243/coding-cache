At this layer, a Media Access Controller is used to generate the frames that will be transmitted 

When transmitting data, this layer adds a header that contains the source and destination [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC Addresses]] to the [[21.025 Frames and Packets#Packets|packet]] received from the [[14.004 Internetwork Layer Protocols|Internetwork Layer]] (Layer 3).
The frame created is forwarded to the physical layer.

Note that the physical layer and this layer is sometimes referred to as the Network Access Layer.
