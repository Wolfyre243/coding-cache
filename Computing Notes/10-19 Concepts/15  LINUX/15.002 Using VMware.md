We can access Linux through

# Bridged Configuration
VM will appear as a seperate system on the physical network
When using this configuration, the guest OS and the OS of the host machine is "bridged" together and connected to the external network
- This allows others to see both the Host Machine and the Virtual Machine, leading to security flaws

# NAT Configuration
VM will be hidden behind the NAT router. VM can see the network, but rest of network cannot see the VM.
This prevents the VM from being exposed to the network

# Host-only Configuration
VM will be isolated within the host machine, but cannot access the internet like the other two.
