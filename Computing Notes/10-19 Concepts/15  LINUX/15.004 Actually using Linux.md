# Logging In
### Root user
Similar to the Windows Administrator; has the highest level of access.
However, because of its power, many Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu), disable this to prevent yourself from self destructing your entire pc

To change root user password:
- Type `sudo -i` and then issue the new password OR
- Type `sudo passwd root` in a single go, where passwd is the new password.
