The use of `/etc/hosts` takes precedence over contacting the DNS server directly.
- DNS server is specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

# Ways to find DNS server
- `dig www.facebook.com` will send a request to the specified server and show the DNS server
- cd into the `/etc/resolv.conf` file.

# The host file
Located in `/etc/hosts`.
If the desired destination is not in this file, contact the DNS server to find the IP address.
You can manually add hosts by doing `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
