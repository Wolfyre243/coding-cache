The system will keep an [[20.006 ARP|ARP]] cache that stores the [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP address]] and [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC Address]] mappings

display this cache using `arp -a`.

When trying to ping an IP address not in the ARP cache, the system will take time to broadcast a request for the computer with the desired IP address's MAC address, and store it in the cache.
