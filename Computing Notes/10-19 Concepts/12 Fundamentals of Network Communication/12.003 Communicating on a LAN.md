# How two computers communicate on a LAN
Two computers A and B, with the IP addresses 10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2 respectively:
1. A user at comp A types `ping 10.1.1.2` at a command prompt.
2. Network software creates a ping message
3. Network protocol packages the message by adding the IP address of the sending and destination computers. At the same time, it acquires the destination computer's [[10.006 Fundamentals of Network Communication#MAC Address|MAC Address]].  
4. The network interface software adds MAC addresses of sending and destination computers.
5. Comp B receives message, verifies that the addresses are correct and then sends a reply to Comp A using steps 2-4.
