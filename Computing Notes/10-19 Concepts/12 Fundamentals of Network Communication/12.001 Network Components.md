# Hardware Components
Hardware components are needed for network communication.
This includes:
- Network Interface Card ([[10.006 Fundamentals of Network Communication#NIC Basics|NIC]]), an add-on card plugged into a [[10.002 Components of a Computer#Motherboard|motherboard]] expansion slot that provides a connection between the computer and the network.
- Network medium - A cable that plugs into the NIC and forms the connection between a computer and the rest of the network. Can be the air waves as well, leading to wireless networks.
- Interconnecting Device - Allows two or more computers to communicate on the network without having to be directly connected to one another. Examples include the [[13.002 Network Switches|switch]] and [[13.003 Wireless Access Points (WAP)|wireless APs]].

# Software Components
### Network clients and servers
- Network **client** software requests info stored on another network computer or device
	- An example of this is Google Chrome web browser.
- Network **server** software allows a computer to share its resources
	- E.g. Apache web server
### NIC Driver
This guy controls the NIC 
### Network Protocols
Protocols such as [[20.001 TCPIP|TCP/IP]], [[20.003 DHCP|DHCP]], 

### Protocols
Defines the rules and formats a computer MUST use when sending info across the network
- E.g. [[20.001 TCPIP|TCP/IP Protocol Stack]].

### NIC Driver
Receives data from protocols and forwards this data to the physical NIC.
