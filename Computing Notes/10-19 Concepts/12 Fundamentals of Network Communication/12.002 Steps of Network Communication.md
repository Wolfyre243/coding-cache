#Computer #Networks 
1. An application tries to access a network resource. This is done by the user's application.
2. Client software detects the attempt to access the network and passes the message on to the [[12.001 Network Components#Protocols|network protocol]]. This is done by the [[12.001 Network Components#Software Components|network software]]. 
3. The protocol packages the message in a format suitable for the network and sends it to the [[12.001 Network Components#NIC Driver|NIC Driver]]. This is done by the network protocol.
4. The NIC driver sends the data in the request to the NIC, which converts it to the necessary signals to be transmitted across the network medium. This is done by the network interface.
