Stands for Network Address Translation

In a nutshell, NAT allows your router to translate a private IP address into a public IP address.

NAT is a method of remapping an [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP Addresses]] into another by modifying the network address info in the IP header of [[21.025 Frames and Packets|packets]] while they are in transit across the [[13.004 Wi-Fi Router|router]]. (remember that routers work with packets.)
