Stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which maps dynamic [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP Addresses]] to [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC addresses]] of computers in a [[21.019 LAN|LAN]].

Hosts on a network are located by their IP address, but [[13.005 Network Interface Cards (NICs)|NICs]] do not have IP addresses.
However, they have MAC addresses.
Hence, ARP is the protocol used to associate the IP address of the computer with the MAC address of its NIC.
