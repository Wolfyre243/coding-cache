Stands for Transmission Control Protocol

Connected oriented, designed for reliable transfer of information in complex internetworks
Slightly slower and more heavyweight
# Ensuring Reliability
TCP is more reliable as:
- If there is a network blip and some of the segments are lost along the way, TCP can recover them, resulting in uncompromised user experience.
- Hence avoids corrupted files

TCP adds Acknowledgement Numbers, Sequencing Numbers, and a Checksum to ensure reliability when transferring data.

# Transporting Data with TCP
The following are the steps involved in data transfer with TCP
### Step 1: Three-way handshake
TCP does something called a three-way handshake to ensure reliability and that data is sent properly

The process:
1. Sender computer sends a SYN (synchronise) message to the other computer
2. Other computer receives the SYN message and replies with an ACK (Acknowledgement) message, and its own SYN message, forming a SYN-ACK message.
3. The sending computer then receives this SYN-ACK message, and finally acknowledges with an ACK message.
4. This forms an open TCP connection. The same process is done when closing down the connection.

### Step 2: Sequencing
Sequencing allows the receiving computer to reorder segments correctly.

The process:
1. TCP assigns each segment a sequence number as they are sent (the sequence number is just one field in the TCP header).
2. This way, the receiving computer can collect these segments, reorder them correctly and determine if any segments are missing.
3. These messages are then acknowledged using acknowledgement numbers.

### Step 3: Checksum
The checksum is the result of a simple calculation ran against the data.

If data has been transmitted successfully, the checksum on the receiving side should match that of the sender's side.
If there was a problem along the way, there would be a checksum mismatch, and the segment would be discarded.
