Stands for Transmission Control Protocol

Connected oriented, designed for reliable transfer of information in complex internetworks
- Being connection-oriented means to first establish a connection with the destination and break this connection once data is transferred.
Slightly slower and more heavyweight
# Ensuring Reliability
TCP is more reliable as:
- If there is a network blip and some of the segments are lost along the way, TCP can recover them, resulting in uncompromised user experience.
- Hence avoids corrupted files

TCP adds Acknowledgement Numbers, Sequencing Numbers, and a Checksum to ensure reliability when transferring data.
# Transporting Data with TCP
The following are the mechanisms involved in data transfer with TCP
### The Three-way handshake
TCP does something called a three-way handshake to ensure reliability and that data is sent properly
This first establishes a connection, where acknowledgements control the flow of data.

The process:
1. Sender computer sends a SYN (synchronise) segment to the other computer
2. Other computer receives the SYN segment and replies with an ACK (Acknowledgement) message, and its own SYN segment, forming a SYN-ACK segment.
   This ACK message will represent the sequence number of the next segment that the receiving end is expecting.
3. The sending computer then receives this SYN-ACK segment, and finally acknowledges with an ACK message.
4. This forms an open TCP connection. The same process is done when closing down the connection.

What is transferred is SYN Segments and SYN-ACK Segments, each having their sequence numbers.
An RST segment is sent instead when the server refuses the request to open the session.

TLDR: The Forward ACK message is a mechanism to tell the sender what the receiving end is expected to receive next.
After every SYN segment, and ACK segment is sent, and this ACK segment represents the next segment to be received.
Seems like the [[21.012 Program Counter Register|Program Counter System]].

##### Error Recovery
- If the receving end does not receive one of the segments, it sends an ACK message with the sequence number of the segment it is expecting (i.e. the segment that was lost in transmission.)
	- When the sender computer receives this ACK message, it will send out the corresponding segment, to ensure proper data transfer.
- If the sender does not receive the ACK segment, it resends the previously sent segment.
	- The receiving end then checks if it is a duplicate; if so, it discards this segment.
	- The receiving end then sends the ACK segment again as usual, continuing the flow.
- The last part of error recovery will be sequencing, explained below.
### Sequencing
Sequencing allows the receiving computer to reorder segments correctly.

When TCP receives data from the Application Layer, the size might be too large to send in one piece
- This is because there is a fixed payload over the network medium.
Hence, TCP breaks down the data into smaller segments (payload by Ethernet is 1518 bytes.) to fit payload.

The process:
1. TCP assigns each segment a sequence number as they are sent (the sequence number is just one field in the TCP header).
2. This way, the receiving computer can collect these segments, reorder them correctly and determine if any segments are missing.
3. These messages are then acknowledged using acknowledgement numbers.

Segmentation in play^^

### Flow Control (With Acknowledgements)
Flow control prevents a specific destination from becoming overwhelmed by data, resulting in dropped [[21.025 Frames and Packets#Packets|packets]].

1. TCP will establish a maximum number of bytes (aka the "Window Size") that can be sent before the destination must send ACK segments to acknowledge the receipt of data.
2. If no acknowledgement is received within a certain amount of time, the sender will retransmit from the point at which an acknowledgement was last received.
3. The window size can be dynamic, and can change every conversation

E.g. Receiver has window size of 2 (arbitrary) initially, meaning sender can send 2 segments before having to wait for an ACK segment.
### Checksum
The checksum is the result of a simple calculation ran against the data.

If data has been transmitted successfully, the checksum on the receiving side should match that of the sender's side.
If there was a problem along the way, there would be a checksum mismatch, and the segment would be discarded.
