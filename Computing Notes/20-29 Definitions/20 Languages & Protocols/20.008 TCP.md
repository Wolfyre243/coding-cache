Stands for Transmission Control Protocol

Connected oriented, designed for reliable transfer of information in complex internetworks
Slightly slower and more lightweight

# Transporting Data with TCP
The following are the steps involved in data transfer with TCP
### Step 1: Three-way handshake
TCP does something called a three-way handshake to ensure reliability and that data is sent properly
The same process is done when closing down the connection

1. Sends a SYN message to the other computer
2. Other computer receives the SYN message and sends its own SYN-ACK message back
3. The computer then receives this SYN-ACK message, and finally sends out a final ACK message
(SYN represents Synchronise and ACK represents Acknowledgement)

### Step 2: Sequencing
TCP gives each segment a sequence number in the TCP header to let the receiving computer know how to arrange the data received.

### Step 3: Checksum
TCP generates a checksum to the receiving computer, where the other computer will check its own checksum against the generated one.

If the checksums match, the data has been transferred successfully.
However, if there is a checksum mismatch, the segment is discarded, and data transfer has failed.
