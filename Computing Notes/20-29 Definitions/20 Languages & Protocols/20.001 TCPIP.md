#Computer #Networks #Protocols 
Stands for **Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**
Needed by operating systems to send and transfer data from client to server

TCP/IP is the most common protocol used on [[12.001 Network Components|networks]] 
TCP/IP uses 2 addresses to identify devices:
- Logical address (IP address) e.g. 192.168.1.41 analogy: *your name*
- Physical address (MAC address) e.g. 24-77-03-FA-24-D0 analogy: your *postal address*
TCP/IP needs an address to deliver data to the correct device on the network.
