A theoretical model that isn't used lol
TCP/IP > OSI

Quoted by Google:
"The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers"

Consists of 7 layers:
- Application Layer ----\\
- Presentation Layer ----> All of these are in **Application Layer** in [[14.001 What is TCPIP|TCP/IP]].
- Session Layer --------/
- Transport Layer
- Network Layer
- Data Link Layer
- Physical Layer --> Relatively new layer in TCP/IP.
