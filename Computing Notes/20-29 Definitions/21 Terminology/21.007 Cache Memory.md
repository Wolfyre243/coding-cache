#Storage #Memory 
Cache memory is a form of RAM (Random Access Memory).

L1 cache speed >> L2 cache >> L3 cache >> Main Memory

Storing frequently used instructions/data in the cache allows for instructions/data to be accessed faster by the CPU
This allows CPU to execute tasks faster.

L1 cache is usually built into the CPU itself
- Stores recently used instructions/data that are most likely required again soon.
- Therefore it is the fastest cache of the 3.

L2 & L3 caches are typically external components that store additional information that may be needed by the CPU to run efficiently.
- Slower than L1 caches.

Below is a diagram that illustrates this connection:
