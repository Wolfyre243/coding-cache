#Computer #Networks 
Packets and frames help to carry data over the internet and LANs respectively.
# Packets
A packet is a chunk of data with a source and destination IP address added to it.
[[13.004 Wi-Fi Router|Routers]] route packets between networks.

# Frame
A packet with the source and destination [[21.029 MAC Address|MAC addresses]] added to it.
The packet is "framed" by the MAC addresses on one end and an error-checking code on the other.
The information added to the front of the data is known as a header and and the information added to the end is called a trailer.

# Transferring Data
Computers transfer info across networks in short bursts of about 1500 [[21.010 Bits and Bytes#Byte|byte]] of data (bursty unlike video streaming)

Reasons for doing so:
- Pauses between bursts allows other computers to transfer data during pauses.
- This allows the receiving computer to process received data, as well as receive data from other computers simultaneously.
- Gives the sending computer an opportunity to receive data from other computers and perform other processing tasks.
- If an error occurs during the transmission of a large file, only the chunks of data involved in the error have to be sent again, and not the entire file (lesser traffic)**
