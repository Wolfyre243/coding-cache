#Networks 
Broadcast domains and collision domains should be thought of as imaginary boundaries drawn by the network components
# Broadcast Domain
A broadcast domain is a scenario in which whenever a device sends out a broadcast message, all devices to pay attention to it. This creates a lot of congestion in the network, known as [[21.019 LAN|LAN]] congestion, which affects the [[21.017 Bandwidth|bandwidth]] of users present in the network (this can be why [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs|hubs]] have shared bandwidth)

# Collision Domain
A collision domain is a scenario in which when a device sends out a message to the network, all devices included in its collision domain have to pay attention to it, no matter whether they were destined to.
The problem arises when two devices send out their messages simultaneously, and a collision occurs (probably due to half-duplex mode)
- This leads them to wait and re-transmit their respective messages, one at a time (also due to [[13.001 Network Repeaters and Hubs#Bandwidth|half-duplex mode]]).

# Efficient Networks
The more broadcast domains and collision domains, the more efficient the network is in providing better bandwidth to all its users.
