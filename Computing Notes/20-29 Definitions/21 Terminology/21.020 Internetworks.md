An internetwork is a network collection of LANs tied together by devices such as routers.

Used due to the following reasons:
- Two or more groups of users and their computers may need to be logically separated but still need to communicate (e.g. two offices holding a meeting in two different locations in the country)
- The number of computers in a single [[21.019 LAN|LAN]] has grown and is no longer efficient.
- The distance between two groups of computers exceeds the capabilities of most LAN devices.
