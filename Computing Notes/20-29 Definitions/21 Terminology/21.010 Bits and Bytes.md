# Storing data
Data on a computer is stored as binary digits, aka bits.
Bits hold a value of either 1 or 0.

5V pulse can represent a 1 bit and 0V can represent a 0 bit.

In a fiber-optic cable, a 1 bit is represented by the presence of light, whereas a 0 bit is represented by the absence of light.
### Byte
A "byte" is a collection of 8 bits, such as 01100010 (represents 'b').

### Word
A "word" is a collection of 16 bits, or 2 bytes.

### Doubleword
A "doubleword" is a collection of 32 bits, or 4 bytes.

### Quadword
A "quadword" is a collection of 64 bits, or 8 bytes.

Max value of a hex char is 15

Hexadecimal of 01000001
0100 = 4
0001 = 1
Therefore 01000001 = 41 in hexadecimal
A = 41 in hex
