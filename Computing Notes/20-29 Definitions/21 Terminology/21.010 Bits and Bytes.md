# Storing data
Data on a computer is stored as binary digits, aka bits.
Bits hold a value of either 1 or 0.

5V pulse can represent a 1 bit and 0V can represent a 0 bit.

In a fiber-optic cable, a 1 bit is represented by the presence of light, whereas a 0 bit is represented by the absence of light.
### Byte
A "byte" is a collection of 8 bits, such as 01100010 (represents 'b').

### Data size in bytes
We can represent data size in decimal or binary:

##### Binary:

^5fe090

1 KB (kilobyte) = 2$^1$$^0$ bytes = 1024 bytes
1 MB (megabyte) = 2$^1$$^0$ * 2$^1$$^0$ = 2$^2$$^0$ = 1,048,576 bytes
1 GB (gigabyte) = 2$^3$$^0$ = 1,073,741,824 bytes

##### Decimal:
1 KB = 10$^3$ bytes = 1000 bytes (1 Thousand)
1 MB = 10$^6$ bytes = 1,000,000 bytes (1 Million)
1 GB = 10$^9$ bytes = 1,000,000,000 bytes (1 Billion)


### Word
A "word" is a collection of 16 bits, or 2 bytes.

### Doubleword
A "doubleword" is a collection of 32 bits, or 4 bytes.

### Quadword
A "quadword" is a collection of 64 bits, or 8 bytes.

# Hexadecimal

 8 , 4 , 2 , 1
2$^3$, 2$^2$, 2$^1$, 2$^0$

Byte = 01000001
A hex is 4 bits: 0100 and 0001 are hexes

Hexadecimal Table

| 8 (2$^3$) | 4 (2$^2$) | 2 (2$^1$) | 1 (2$^0$) | Hex Value |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| 0         | 0         | 0         | 1         | 1         |
| 0         | 0         | 1         | 0         | 2         |
| 0         | 0         | 1         | 1         | 3         |
| 1         | 0         | 1         | 0         | A (10)    |
| 1         | 0         | 1         | 1         | B (11)    |
| 1         | 1         | 0         | 0         | C (12)    |
| 1         | 1         | 1         | 1         | F (15)    |
Max value of a hex char is 15

Hexadecimal of 01000001
0100 = 4
0001 = 1
Therefore 01000001 = 41 in hexadecimal
A = 41 in hex

# Decimal
Similar to hexadecimal, but instead adds up the entire byte

128, 64, 32, 16, 8 , 4 , 2 , 1
 2$^7$ , 2$^6$, 2$^5$, 2$^4$ , 2$^3$, 2$^2$, 2$^1$, 2$^0$

E.g. 
01000001 = 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 65

A = 65 in decimal

# ASCII
Stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange

It is a coding system that uses 8 bits (1 byte) to represent characters

A is represented as 01000001
