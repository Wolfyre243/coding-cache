A subnet mask or netmask tells us which portion of the [[21.023 IP Addresses|IP Address]] is the network portion and which part is the host.

For example, a subnet mask of /24 appended to the IP address 192.1.2.55:
Therefore, we know that the first 24 bits of the IP address belong to the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are for the host.

192.1.2 -> network
55 -> host
