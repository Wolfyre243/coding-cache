The host address is used to identify a particular device attached to the network.

The number of osts can be represented as 2$^n$ - 2, where n is the number of host bits (usually 8).

There are 2 host addresses:
- The first address of the network is assigned to the network
	- E.g. 192.168.1.0 (host is 0)
- The last address is used as a broadcast address.
	- E.g. 192.168.1.255 (host is 255)
